# NorBot Challenge Code of Conduct

## Welcome!
We're excited to welcome everyone we can to our Slack community.

The current admins are:

- @albert
- @eirik
- @scalpel78
- @anders
- @poohma
- @kjellb

Here are some general guidelines for you so that we can maintain that welcoming feeling for everyone.

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, 
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. 
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. 
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

- Our Code of Conduct applies to our Slack team the same as it does our in person events.
- Text based conversations don't have the same intricacies of verbal communication. 
- Assume best intent from the person on the other side of the conversation and take care to word things well and be understanding.


### NorBot Challenge values
These are the values to which people in the NorBot Challenge community should aspire.

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
  - Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
- Be thoughtful
  - Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  - Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
- Be respectful
  - In particular, respect differences of opinion.
- Be charitable
  - Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
  - When we do disagree, try to understand why.
- Avoid destructive behavior:
  - Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  - Unconstructive criticism: don’t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  - Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  - Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  - Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.
 
People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

These actions are explicitly forbidden in NorBot Challenge community:

- Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
