# Rules for Freestyle during The NorBot Challenge

## Introduction
>In Freestyle, competitors are given the possibility to show robots that do not qualify in any other
categories. This is a competition where almost all robots may enter. The goal of the competition is
to show some different robots that might also have a useful purpose. If you have any questions about the competition, please feel free to contact us at; info@norbot.net.

## Rules for Freestyle

## 1. Goal
    1. The goal of the competition is that the competitors should show a robot they have built. The robot is judged based on the following categories: Hardware, intelligence, aesthetics, presentation, use and innovation. The robot with the most points win.
    2. It is allowed to compete with a solution consisting of several robots.

## 2. The Robot
    1. The team has to have developed a significant part of either the hardware and/or the software themselves.
    2. The robot must not harm any humans or surroundings in any way.
    3. Otherwise, there are no restrictions.

## 3. Inspection
    1. The championship staff has the right to inspect the robot at any time, to check that it is compliant to the rules.
    2. The championship staff has the right to demand changes to the robot if it is not compliant to the rules.
    3. If you cannot perform the changes instructed, the robot may be disqualified from the competition.

## 4. The Arena/Exhibition
    1. Each team will gain access to an exhibition booth consisting of a table and a place to hang a poster behind the table. There they are supposed to present their robot to visitors who wants to come and look at it. The poster should not be larger than A1, but we could make exceptions if you have a good reason (please contact us on beforehand). If the robot is to large to fit in the venue, please contact us on beforehand and we will try and solve this.
    2. It is allowed to bring materials for the robot to interact with. If your robot requires large space or any other special equipment, please contact us on beforehand and we will try to solve it the best way we can.
    3. NorBot Challenge does not take any responsibility for damage or theft to your robot or belongings during the exhibition, but we will of course try and prevent this as much as we can.

## 5. The competition
    1. The team will be judged based on several criteria. The maximum score for each criteria is 5 points. If the team has some parts not constructed by themselves (such as using a complete robot kit) it will not score as many points in the appropriate category. The categories are explained in more detail below:
      1. **Hardware** is judged based on the advanced level of the hardware. If the robot for example is hard to construct or contains advanced solutions and components this gives more points. Smart exploit of simple hardware and unusual but brilliant solutions also gives more points.
      2. **Intelligence** is judged based on the how advanced the software is. If the robot can perform something advanced thanks to the software it scores high points. Interaction between robot and human and also between robot and robot also gives many points.
      3. **Aesthetics** is judged based on how “good-looking” the robot is. A robot which looks nice and clean scores higher point than a robot made out of tape and cables. It is however not written in stone that a robot built using only tape and cables is an ugly robot.
      4. **Presentation** is judged based on how well the team manages to tell the world about the functions of the robot. The category is judged both based on activity in the booth and the official presentation. The design of the poster also has some weight in this category.
      5. **Innovation** is judged base on how innovative the robot concept is. Both hardware and software is taken into account. The robot must be good example of new thinking to score high points in this category.
      6. **Use** is judged based on how useful the robot is. If the robot can for example help humans with things such as daily tasks it scores high point in this category.

## 6. Presentation
  1.  All competing teams has the possibility (not mandatory however) to hold a short presentation on a stage in front of all visitors and competitors. The presentation may be a maximum of 15 minutes long. A computer projector will be available (but bring your own laptop). Please contact us on beforehand if you are planning to hold this presentation.

## 7. Rule conflicts
    1. Use common sense when interpreting the rules. If there are any rules conflicts, the main referee has the final word to say what is right and wrong.
