# Rules for Folkrace during The NorBot Challenge

## Introduction
>The goal of the competition Folkrace is to capture the happy and playful spirit of the “Folkrace movement”. In short, the robot shall travel around a course competing with several other robots at the same time.
The complete rules follows below. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to contact us at; info@norbot.net.

## Rules for Folkrace

## 1. Goal
    1. The goal is that the robot shall try to complete as many full laps around the walled course as possible before the time runs out.

## 2. The Robot
    1. The robot has to be autonomous, no external control mechanisms are allowed during it's run.
    2. The robot may be altered during the competition as long as it is still compliant to the rules. All physical change of the robot must be reported to the championship staff for approval. Alteration of software does not need to be reported.
    3. The robot may not change form during the race, i.e. the robot may not be built to expand beyond the size restrictions. The robot is however not disqualified if something brakes and expands beyond the size restrictions as result of this.
    4. The robot may not be in a way that may cause it to harm any other robot, any human or its surroundings. Normal pushes and bangs are not considered as “harm another robot”.
    5. The robot may not:
      1. Emit any gases, liquids or powder.
      2. Scratch or in any other way intentionally damage the surface of the course.
      3. Actively try to jam the other robot with e.g. EMP or other disturbance signals
      4. Fire projectiles
      5. Use anchoring devices to attach itself to the other robots.
      6. Fly as a result of its own power.
    6. The robot must be prepared for remote start according to the document “System for starting sumo robots”.
    7. The measurements of the robot may not exceed:
      1. Height: 15 cm
      2. Width: 15 cm
      3. Length: 20 cm
    8. Tolerances for measurements must follow *DIN ISO 2768-1 class v*
    9. The mass of the robot may not exceed 1 kg, with tolerances of &plusmn; 2.0g.
    10. The robot shall have a coloured marking clearly visible, both on top and under the robot (for the event that the robot is upside-down). The colour marking may be for example an RGB-led or coloured tape, provided by the championship management.
    11. The robot must be able to complete a full lap on the course in less than 3 minutes. This is controlled during the robot registration.


## 3. Inspection
    1. The championship staff has the right to inspect the robot at any time, to check that it is compliant to the rules.
    2. The championship staff has the right to demand changes to the robot if it is not compliant to the rules.
    3. If you cannot perform the changes instructed, the robot may be disqualified from the competition.
    4. During the registration, the robot has to complete a full lap to be allowed to compete. This lap is performed with no other robots on the course.

## 4. The Arena/Course
    1. The surface of the course is mostly matte black. The wall around the course is white and about 12 cm high. The width of the course varies and is most often 80 cm wide.
    2. The course may have simpler obstacles, such as small hills. The colour of the course may also shift in some places.
    3. There are two markings on the course (one start line and one middle line). The colour of these is unspecified and might vary.

## 5. The Competition
    1. A total of 4 robots competes at the same time on the course. The robot with the most points after 3 minutes wins. If more than one robot has the same amount of points after, the robot closest to completing a lap wins.
    2. At start the competitors place their robots on the starting line (see 6.1-3 for details). Then they move away from the course. Afterwards the referee asks the competitors if they are ready and then sends the start signal. The robots may not move until the start signal is sent.
    3. If a robot starts to move before the start signal is sent, this is considered a false start. Each robot may perform one false start per race. If a robot performs a second false start, it is disqualified from the race and is removed.
    4. On the course, there are two markings: the start line and the middle line. Every time a robot passes the start line in the correct direction (which is the same direction the robots started) the robot is awarded one point.
    5. If a robot passes the start or middle line in the wrong direction, it is picked up by the competition staff and immediately put down in the correct direction again.
    6. The competitors may at any time alert to the competition staff that they want their robot corrected (called “to flag”). This can happen for example when the robot is stuck, is upside-down or is traveling in the wrong direction. When the competitor signals, the robot is picked up by the competition staff and immediately put down in the correct direction again. The robot is then deducted one point.
      1. If there is a situations where several robots are stuck in each other, all affected robots loses one point, and the staff corrects the incident only when all participants "flag".
    7. Competitors may at any time give up. This is done by signalling to the referee who then removes to robot from the course. Alternatively, the competitor may remove his or her robot upon the judges instruction.
    8.  If the judge considers the rules to be violated by one robot, it will be disqualified and removed from the course.

## 6. Placement
    1. Placement at the start line should have a spacing of at least 5 cm to the edge and 5 cm to the next robot.
    3. The start position of each robot is decided by chance.
    2. All robots start in the same direction.

## 7. Rule Conflicts
    1. Use common sense when interpreting the rules. If there are any rules conflicts, the main referee has the final word to say what is right and wrong.
