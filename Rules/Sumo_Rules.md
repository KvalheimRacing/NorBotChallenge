# Rules for Sumo during The NorBot Challenge

## Introduction
>The rules for sumo are based on what is called “Sumo, Japanese class”. The purpose of the
game is to make the opposing robot leave the dohyo. The complete rules follows below. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to contact us at; info@norbot.net.

## Rules for Standard & Mini Sumo

## 1. Goal
    1. The purpose of the game is to make the opposing robot leave the dohyo. A robot counts as out when any part of the robot touches any surface other than the top surface of the dohyo.
    2. If something would fall of the robot and drop outside the dohyo, the robot counts as out and has thereby lost that round.


## 2. The robot
    1. The robot has to be autonomous, no external control mechanisms are allowed during the match.
    2. The robot may be altered during between matches (but not rounds, one match consists of several rounds), as long as it is still compliant to the rules. All physical change of the robot must be reported to the championship staff for approval. Alteration of software does not need to be reported.
    3. The robot may not be in a way that may cause it to harm another robot, human or its surroundings. Normal pushes and bangs are not considered as “harm to another robot”.
    4. The robot may not:
      1. Emit any gases, liquids or powder.
      2. Scratch or in any other way intentionally damage the surface of the course.
      3. Actively try to jam the other robot with e.g. EMP or other disturbance signals
      4. Fire projectiles
      5. Use anchoring devices such as vacuum fans or suction cups. For the standard class, certain types of anchoring equipment is allowed. Note that the robot still has to pass the “paper” test, see point 2.5.
      6. Fly as a result of its own power.
    5. If the robot in active mode is placed on top of a piece of paper (standard A4 printing paper) and then lifted straight up, the paper must not stick to the robot for more than 1 second.
    6. The robot must be prepared for remote start according to the document “System for starting sumo robots”. This only applies for the classes Standard, Mini, Micro and Nano.
    7. The size of the robot must not exceed the lengths given in the table below. Please note that these size restrictions are only mandatory before the referee has given the start signal. Tolerances for measurements must follow *DIN ISO 2768-1 class v*.
    8. The mass of the robot must not exceed the weights in the table below.
    9. Special rules for Lego sumo: The robot may only be built from LEGO® parts. This includes;
      1. Every part produced and distributed by LEGO®.
      2. Every part manufactured by a third party and licensed by LEGO®.

  Class    | Mass (g) | Size (width x deapth x height, in cm)
  -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------
  Standard | 3000     | 20 x 20 x unlimited
  Mini     | 500      | 10 x 10 x unlimited
  Micro    | 100      | 5 x 5 x 5
  Nano     | 25       | 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5
  Pico     | 5        | 1.25 x 1.25 x 1.25
  Lego     | 1000     | 15 x 15 x unlimited    


## 3. Inspection
    1. The championship staff has the right to inspect the robot at any time, to check that it is compliant to the rules.
    2. The championship staff has the right to demand changes to the robot if it is not compliant to the rules.
    3. If you cannot perform the changes instructed, the robot may lose the round, the match, or be disqualified from the competition.
    4. The championship staff will also check the start-up sequence and inform the contestant if there is any problems (such as it has a scoop which may fall out during the count down). The front and back of the robot is checked since this matters during the placement procedure (see 6.2). If there are any doubts, the front direction is decided by the championship staff.

## 4. The Arena - Dohyo (see attachments below)
    1. The dohyo consists of a round board with a diameter given in the table below.
    2. The surface is painted black, except for a white border with width defined in the table below.
    3. The height of the dohyo surface above the ground is at least the defined size in the table below.
    4. Around the dohyo, there is an area called “ring area”. In the ring area, nothing or no one (except for the robots and the dohyo) can be located. The ring area is fat and reaches at least the distance defined in the table below, from the edge of the dohyo.
    5. The material of the dohyo is defined in the table below.

Class     | Diameter (cm) | Height above ground (cm) | Edge line with (cm) | Ring area size (cm) | Material
--------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |---------------------| --------------------|---------
Standard  | 154           | 5                        | 5                   | 100                 | Steel/Wood
Mini/Lego | 77            | 2.5                      | 2.5                 | 50                  | Wood
Micro     | 38.5          | 1.25                     | 1.25                | 25                  | Wood
Nano      | 19.25         | 0.625                    | 0.625               | 25                  | Wood/Acrylic
Pico      | 9.625         | 0.3125                   | 0.3125              | 25                  | Wood/Acrylic

## 5. The Competition
    1. A round is never more than 3 minutes long. If no robot leaves the course before the time is up it the round is declared a draw.
    2.  The match is played as best of 3 rounds (5 rounds in the endgame). In the group game, a match may end in a draw. If a match in the endgame is a draw after 5 rounds, additional rounds are played until one robot is victorious. If there is a shortage of time, the number of rounds during the endgame may be cut to 3. If the match has gone on for a large number of rounds without a robot winning, the referee may declare judgement. If the following round also ends in a draw, the most active robot will be declared the winner.
    3. The robot must be ready to start at the appointed time. If it is not ready the judge may declare the opposing team as winners of the match.
    4. The starting sequence is as follows;
      1. First both robots are placed according to the rules below (in chapter 6). Note that only one member from each team may approach the dohyo.
      2. Afterwards, the referee will remove the cross dividing the dohyo in its four quadrants. The competitors ready their robots for start and then leaves the ring area together with the referee.
      3. The referee asks the competitors if they are ready, and the sends the signal allowing the robots to start (see point 2.6). Before the referee has given the start signal, the robots may not move, but there are some exceptions;
        1. The robots are allowed to move some parts (such as sweeping with a sensor) as long as these movements does not violate the size restrictions. If a robot moves or violates the size restrictions before the referee has sent the start signal it counts as a false start.
      4. A robot may perform one false start each match. Additional false start will make the robot lose that round.
      5. It is allowed to stop the round before the referee has sent the start signal as long as the robot is still compliant to the rules. This does not cause loss of the round.
    5. The competitors are allowed to stop the round at any moment by either signaling to the referee or stepping into the security area. If this is done the round is lost and the opposing team wins the round.
    6. The competitors are also allowed to agree to stop the round (i.e. if the robots get stuck on each other and no progress is made). If so, the round is considered a draw.
    7. The competitors may take a 5 minute break to adjust the robot. This is allowed only once per match. If possible, the next match can be carried out during this break.
    8. If the judge considers the rules to be violated by one robot the opposing competitor wins the round. In the case of grave faults the match is lost.

## 6. Placement
    1. At the beginning of each match chance determines which team is to be the first to put its robot on the course.
    2. The referee puts a cross in the middle of the dohyo. This cross has two arrows and splits the dohyo into 4 quadrants, with two quadrants specially marked (se pictures at the bottom for further explanations). The first competitor then places his or her robot somewhere in the quadrant instructed by the referee with the front facing in the direction of the arrow. After placement the robot may not be moved.
    3. After the first competitor is done the other competitor places his or her robot in the same fashion.
    4. In the next round the winner of the previous round places out his or her robot first. If the previous round was a draw, the order of placement is the same as the previous round.

## 7. Rule Conflicts
    1. Use common sense when interpreting the rules. If there are any rules conflicts, the main referee has the final word to say what is right and wrong.
